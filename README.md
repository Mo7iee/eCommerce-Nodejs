🛒 E-Commerce Backend built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and TypeScript. This project provides the core backend functionality for an online shopping platform, including JWT-based user authentication, product management (CRUD operations), and shopping cart handling (adding, updating, and removing items). It demonstrates a clean architecture with clear separation between models, routes, and services, along with a reusable JWT validation middleware for secure access control.
